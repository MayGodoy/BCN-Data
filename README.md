# BCN-Data

I started this project as a test to win a Scholarship in 2020. After winning it, I decided to apply all my new knowledge to do it in python. 
All the datasets are from the OpenBCN page.  
The initial idea it's answered some questions for the test. But this is explored and show Barcelona, the city I live in, and know it better.
